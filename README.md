# Widewall
Widewall concept is based on a simple classic in the social networking world where a user can sign in with a Google account. The app has two rooms.

The first room is called universal, where anyone in the world can be present. The second room is local where the people of one country can be there.

User can write in timeline, voice recording, image posting, can also send private messages and follow others.
